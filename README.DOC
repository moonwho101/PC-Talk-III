	   you are encouraged to copy this program as described below.

		  ---------------------------------------------
	FREEWARE user-supported software is an experiment in distributing
	computer programs, based on three principles:

	First, that the value and utility of software is best assessed by
	the user on his/her own system.  Only after using a program can
	one really determine whether it serves personal applications,
	needs, and tastes.

	Second, that the creation of independent personal computer
	software can and should be supported by the computing community.

	Finally, that copying of programs should be encouraged,
	rather than restricted. The ease with which software can be
	distributed outside traditional commercial channels reflects the
	strength, rather than the weakness, of electronic information.

	The user-supported concept:

	Anyone may request a copy of a user-supported program by sending
	a blank, formatted disk to the program author together with an
	addressed, postage-paid return mailer. A copy of the program,
	with documentation, will be sent by return mail on the user's disk.

	The program carries a notice suggesting a contribution for the
	program. Making a contribution is voluntary on the part of the user.

	The program may also be ordered by mail for an advance contribution.

	Regardless of whether a contribution is made, the user is encouraged
	to copy the program for trial use by others on a private, non-
	commercial basis.  Payment for use is discretionary on the part of
	each subsequent user.

	Will the user-supported concept really work?

	Up to now, distribution of software has relied either on
	restricting access (and charging for the cost of doing so), or
	anonymously casting programs into the public domain.  The user-
	supported concept is a way for the computing community to support
	and encourage creative work outside the traditional marketplace.

	This is an experiment in economics more than altruism. Free
	distribution of software and voluntary payment for its use
	eliminates the need for money to be spent on marketing,
	advertising, and copy protection schemes. Users can obtain
	quality software at reduced cost, while still supporting program
	authors.  And the most useful programs survive, based purely on
	their usefulness.

	Please join the experiment.

	FREEWARE is the trademark of The Headlands Press for its user-
	supported software, but we invite all software authors to
	participate in this distribution concept.

	We would like to publish a FREEWARE CATALOG of user-supported
	software by program authors who are willing to make their work
	available on a free, non-restricted basis. If you would like your
	program listed, please send a description of the program
	(including system requirements) and the address to which requests
	for copies should be sent. Fulfilling requests and suggesting
	contributions are the sole responsibility of each program author.
	Listings in the catalog are free.

	We welcome your comments about the user-supported concept.
	Thank you for your support.
