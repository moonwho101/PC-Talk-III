                       === Features of PC-TALK III ===


	This brief summary is to acquaint you with some of the 
	key features in PC-TALK III.  Each of these features is
	described in detail in the documentation.


	1. PC-TALK III is supplied in an interpreter BASIC source code
	version (PC-TALK.BAS) for systems with 64K of memory and a
	compiled BASIC version (PC-TALK.EXE) for systems with 128K or
	more of memory.  The .EXE version will give optimum performance
	and is recommended if you have sufficient memory.

	To run PC-TALK ...
	-- If you have 64K of memory, type 'TALK64' <Enter>.
	-- If you have 128K or more of memory, type 'TALK128' <Enter>.

	2. The 'fast' mode from previous versions has been eliminated.
	All features now operate fully at up to 1200 baud in both the
	BASIC interpreter and the BASIC compiled version.

	3. A Screendump feature (Alt-S) now permits writing the contents
	of the screen to a disk file.

	4. A margin Width feature (Alt-W) signals when keyboard input has
	exceeded a specifiable right margin.

	5. Three Transmit options are now provided for transmitting
	binary files (=b), for transmitting files with line pacing (=p),
	and for transmitting and receiving files using the XMODEM error-
	checking protocol (=x).

	6. The Dialing Directory (Alt-D) has been expanded to sixty entry
	capacity.  Optional parameters allow selective character
	stripping and/or converting and for storing pacing instructions
	for each entry.

	7. An auto-redial feature has been added (Alt-Q).

	8. There are now forty possible permanent input strings (Alt-K).
	These permanent strings are now stored to be input with the
	Function keys in combination with the Alt, Shift, and Ctrl keys.

	9. The temporary input strings (Alt-=) have been switched to the
	ten key combinations Alt-1 through Alt-0.

	10. Because of the expansion of the Dialing Directory and the
	Function Key Directory, the special keys for dialing CompuServe
	and the Source and for sending specific commands to these
	networks have been eliminated.

		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 5


	11. A routine has been added for interactively specifying and
	changing all program defaults while the program is running (Alt-
	F).

	12. The conventions for specifying files and input strings within
	the program have been standardized.  Control characters can now
	be specified as part of input strings.


	Even if you are familiar with earlier versions of PC-TALK, it is
	recommended that you read through the entire documentation, most
	of which has been thoroughly revised.

	The PC-TALK III User's Guide is 70 pages long.  It is supplied on
	a file called PC-TALK.DOC, which is either on the program disk,
	or on a separately labeled disk if two disks have been provided.

	To print the User's Guide, see the instructions at paragraph 9 of
	the following section, "Making Working Copies of PC-TALK."


	I hope that you find PC-TALK III to be more useful, and just as
	friendly, as version 2.00.

		    === Making Working Copies of PC-TALK ===


	Before you use your PC-TALK program disk(s), you should make a
	working copy of the program.  Follow these steps carefully:


	(Please note that you may have been provided with two disks,
	marked "PC-TALK.III" and "PC-TALK.DOC", or a single disk marked
	"PC-TALK.III".  If you have been provided with a single disk, it
	contains all of the necessary PC-TALK files.)


	1. Place your own copy of PC-DOS (any version)
	in drive A and press the Ctrl-Alt-Del keys simultaneously.  Enter
	the date and time, when required.  You should see the DOS A> prompt.


	2. Place a blank disk (or one that can be REFORMATTED) in drive B.


	3. Type 'FORMAT B:/S' <Enter>.  This will format the disk in
	drive B with the DOS system and command files.


	4. Type 'COPY BASIC.COM B:' <Enter>. This will copy the file
	BASIC.COM to the disk in drive B.


	5. Now remove the DOS disk from drive A and insert the PC-TALK.III
	program disk in drive A.


	6. Type 'COPY *.* B:' <Enter>. This will copy all the files from
	the program disk onto the disk in drive B.


	7. Remove the program disk from drive A and store it in a safe
	place.	Take the disk from drive B and label it "PC-TALK.III".
	Use this as your working program disk.


	8. If you have been provided a separate disk marked "PC-TALK.DOC",
	repeat steps 1 through 7 above, using the PC-TALK.DOC disk.

		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 10




	9. Before you start using the program, please make sure that you
	have printed and read the PC-TALK III User's Guide.

	-- If you have been provided with two disks, place the working
	copy of the PC-TALK.DOC disk in drive A.

	-- If you have been provided with one disk, place the working
	copy of the PC-TALK.III disk in drive A.

	Now type 'PRINTDOC' <Enter> and follow the screen prompts.  This
	will print the file PC-TALK.DOC.


	10. You are now ready to run PC-TALK. Place the working program
	disk marked PC-TALK.III in drive A and proceed with the following
	instructions, "Starting PC-TALK".

			    === Starting PC-TALK ===



	First make sure that PC-DOS is loaded so that you see the A>

	prompt. Place the disk marked "PC-TALK.III" in drive A. Then...


	-- If you have 64K of memory, type 'TALK64' <Enter>.

	   This will load and run the BASIC file PC-TALK.BAS.


	-- If you have 128K or more of memory, type 'TALK128' <Enter>.

	   This will load and run the compiled BASIC file PC-TALK.EXE.

	   You can also run PC-TALK.EXE by simply typing 'PC-TALK' <Enter>.



	When you see the prompt "===Proceed ..." PC-TALK is in operation.

	At this point, you should turn on your modem, if you have not

	already done so.


	-- If you have a direct connection modem:

	   You can proceed to send the appropriate modem commands

	   directly from the keyboard. (Making use of auto-dialing

	   features is described in the documentation under "The Dialing

	   Directory.")


	-- If you have an acoustic modem:

	   Dial the phone number you wish, place the telephone receiver

	   in the modem cradle, and switch to 'Data'. Once you have made

	   a connection, you can proceed with keyboard instructions.


	At this point, your PC has been set up as a "dumb" terminal,

	connected with the remote computer.  You can send information to

	the remote computer by typing on the keyboard, and see

	information sent by the remote computer displayed on your screen.


	NOTE: IF YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR KEYBOARD INPUT, press Alt-E to put

	the program into Echo mode.


	PC-TALK is capable of doing many "smart" things too, such as

	receiving and sending disk files, dialing phone calls, and

	storing commands for future use.  All the program features are

	described in the documentation, which is contained in a file on

	the program disk called PC-TALK.DOC.


	********** PLEASE PRINT AND READ THE DOCUMENTATION! **********

	This will save you from having unanswered questions and greatly

	increase your enjoyment of the program.


	To print the documentation, follow these instructions:


	-- If you have been provided with two disks, place the working

	   copy of the PC-TALK.DOC disk in drive A.

	-- If you have been provided with one disk, place the working

	   copy of the PC-TALK.III disk in drive A.


	*** Now type 'PRINTDOC' <Enter> and follow the screen prompts.

	This will print the file PC-TALK.DOC.  Please take some time to

	read through the documentation before trying to use the program.

		     === Screen, Keyboard, and Printing ===



	Echo:  Alt-E


	With some systems, the remote computer will send back to your

	screen the characters you type at the keyboard.  This is known as

	"full duplex" communications.  In other cases, the remote

	computer will not send back the characters you type ("half

	duplex").  You can adjust for either of these situations with the

	Echo option, which is toggled on and off by pressing Alt-E.


	If you can't see your own keyboard input on the screen once

	communications are in progress, turn on the Echo option (Alt-E).

	This might make your modem commands appear as double characters,

	but should produce proper screen output during communications.


	If your regular communications input appears as double charac-

	ters, disable the Echo function by pressing Alt-E.

		    ----------------------------------------


	The Width Alarm: Alt-W


	Many remote systems place a limit on the length of a line which

	can be entered.  It can be a nuisance to have to keep track of

	this limit when typing on the screen.


	As you send information using the keyboard, you will notice that

	the program beeps when you type more than 70 characters on a

	line.  This is the Width alarm feature.  It operates like the

		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 14



	margin alarm on a typewriter.


	The beeps will continue until you press the <Enter> key or until

	you have typed more than ten additional characters.  The beeps

	are merely reminders--the characters are still sent as typed,

	even if the alarm sounds.


	You can specify a different margin width by pressing Alt-W.  If

	you want to disable the Width alarm, enter 0 (zero) as the value

	for the margin width.

		    ----------------------------------------


	Printscreen: Shift-PrtSc


	At any time during program operation, hitting the Shift key in

	combination with the PrtSc key will print the contents of the

	screen to the printer. (This is the regular DOS function).

		    ----------------------------------------


	Simultaneous Printout: Ctrl-PrtSc (or Ctrl-PgUp)


	You can also produce simultaneous printout while communications

	are in progress by pressing Ctrl-PrtSc or Ctrl-PgUp. A message

	will indicate "===PRINTOUT ON===" and all subsequent information

	displayed on the screen will be sent to the printer as well.


	You can disable the Printout function by hitting Ctrl-PrtSc or

	Ctrl-PgUp again. A message "===PRINTOUT OFF===" will be displayed

	and the Printout function will be toggled off. The Printout

	function can be turned on and off without disturbing

	communications.


	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 15




	If the Printout function is invoked when the printer is not

	turned on, a message "===CHECK PRINTER===" will appear, the function

	will remain off, and communications will continue.


	**Applications Notes:

	Running the Printout option may slow communications because many

	printers cannot keep pace with the communications rate.  If you

	are communicating at 1200 baud (described below under "Commu-

	nications Parameters") you should not try to run simultaneous

	printout, as you will likely overflow the communications buffer.

	If this happens, the program will attempt to recover by turning

	off the Printout function.


	A new feature in PC-TALK III buffers the printout to take correct

	account of backspace characters within each line.


	If you happen to run the BASIC interpreter version of the program

	under BASIC 2.0, the Ctrl-PrtSc key will turn on continuous

	printing, but not with PC-TALK's support features described

	above.	In this case, you should use the Ctrl-PgUp key to control

	the Printout function.	(Note, however, that if you have enough

	memory to run BASIC 2.0, you will get better performance by

	running the compiled version of the program, PC-TALK.EXE. See

	"Starting PC-TALK", above.)

	Screendump: Alt-S


	Another new feature in PC-TALK III allows you to dump the

	contents of the screen to a disk file at any time by pressing

	Alt-S.


	When you start the program, the Screendump file is a file on

	drive B called SCRNDUMP.PCT.  Each time you press Alt-S, the

	screen contents is appended to that file.  The date and time is

	automatically recorded for each screendump.


	You can specify a different Screendump file from within the

	Default routine (described below).

		    ----------------------------------------


	Clearscreen: Alt-C


	Pressing Alt-C will clear the screen at any time.  This command

	does not send any character or signal to the remote computer.

		    === Receiving and Transmitting Files ===



	Receiving a File: Alt-R (or PgDn)


	The file receiving routine permits you to save information you

	receive from a remote computer on your own disk files. It

	operates manually and requires no special protocol.


	To start the Receiving routine, press Alt-R. The program will ask

	for a drive and filename under which to receive the file.


	Once the Receiving routine is in operation, you will see a

	reminder on line 25 of the screen indicating the name of the file

	being received.  From that point on, all information passing

	through the communications port, whether it is being typed from

	your keyboard or coming from the remote computer, will be saved

	to the specified disk file.


	To guard against accidentally erasing existing files, if a

	filename is specified that already exists on the disk, the new

	input will be appended to the end of the existing file.


	To terminate receipt of the file, press Alt-R once again.  You

	can receive different files to disk, or keep appending to the

	same disk file, many times during a communications session.


	**Applications and Advanced Features:

	Certain remote computer systems may send unwanted characters to

	your computer. If you have need to strip or convert certain

	characters as they are being received, you can specify those

	characters with the Strip option described below.


	PC-TALK can receive binary files without any special file

	receiving specification.  You do have to be careful, however, to

	open and close your file for receiving so that you do not receive

	any extraneous characters or messages from the remote computer.


	The recommended procedure for receiving binary files is to have

	the Message option (described below) ON for the receiving

	computer and OFF for the transmitting computer and for the

	transmitting computer operator to give the receiving computer

	ample time to open and close the file.	Please note also that if

	you want to receive a binary file, you must not have any

	stripping in effect and must be communicating at 8 data bits.

	(These communications parameters are described below.)


	*** PLEASE NOTE that the best way to receive and transmit

	binary files with PC-TALK is by using the XMODEM error-checking

	protocol, which is described below.

	Transmitting a File:  Alt-T


	Just as you can receive information and store it on disk files,

	you can transmit information from your disk files to the remote

	computer.


	The regular file transmitting routine is "plain vanilla" -- it

	requires no special protocol from the remote computer. It can

	therefore be used to send your disk files to virtually any other

	personal computer, to network bulletin boards, and to many large

	computer systems.


	To start the Transmit routine, press Alt-T. The program will then

	ask for the specification of the file to be transmitted. Once you

	have given the specification and press the <Enter> key,

	transmission of the file will proceed.


	Once transmission is in progress, you will see the text of your

	file displayed on the screen. Line 25 of the screen will indicate

	the name of the file being transmitted and the approximate

	minutes remaining to complete the transmission. The transmission

	routine will terminate automatically at the end of the file.


	You can terminate transmission manually at any time by pressing

	Alt-T.


	**Applications and Advanced Features:

	The transmitting routine can be used to send files to personal

	computers and to network bulletin board services. When you are



	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 20


	ready to send your file, start the Transmit routine (Alt-T),

	specify the file to be sent, and press <Enter>.  None of the

	specification prompts you see on your screen will be sent to the

	remote computer -- only the text of your file.


	If the remote computer requires a special character to begin

	receipt of the file, it should be sent manually via the keyboard

	prior to giving the Alt-T command.

		    ----------------------------------------


	**File Transmitting Options:


	PC-TALK offers some advanced transmit options for sending binary

	files, for pacing transmission, and for transmitting with an

	error-checking protocol.  In each case, the option is invoked by

	adding an equals sign plus the letters 'b', 'p', or 'x' to the

	end of the file specification.	Each of these options is

	described below; however, it is recommended that you do not try

	these options until you are familiar with the basic features of

	the program.

		    ----------------------------------------


	The Binary transmit option: '=b'


	PC-TALK permits transmitting binary files (.COM  and .EXE files

	and BASIC programs not saved in ASCII format).	To transmit a

	binary file, add '=b' to the end of the transmit file

	specification.


		 For example, to transmit the file MYFILE.COM, you would

		 give the transmit file specification by typing


	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 21



		 'MYFILE.COM=b' <Enter>. (It does not matter whether the

		 'b' is typed in upper or lower case.)


	When you transmit using the binary option, the text of the file

	will not be displayed on the screen.


	You must be communicating at 8 data bits (No parity) to transmit

	a binary file. The binary transmit option is an advanced feature.

		    ----------------------------------------


	The Pacing transmit option: '=p'


	Because of the increased performance of this version of PC-TALK,

	the Transmit routine may operate too fast for some remote

	computers (such as the Source and many mainframe systems).  PC-

	TALK now offers a Pacing option to slow down transmission of

	files.	This feature will send your file to the remote computer

	one line at a time, pausing between lines.


	To invoke the Pacing option, specify '=p' following the

	specification of the file to transmit; e.g., 'MYFILE.123=p'.

	At this point you have two options:


	-- If you want the line pacing to be governed by a time delay,

	enter a number following the '=p' to indicate how many seconds to

	pause between transmission of lines of your file.


		 For example, if you specified 'MYFILE.123=p2', the

		 program would pause approximately two seconds between

		 lines.




	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 22


	You can enter a fractional number, such as '=p.5' for a half-

	second pause.  You should experiment with your remote system to

	determine the optimum time delay for pacing.


	-- The second line pacing option waits for a prompt from the

	remote computer before sending the next line.  This is invoked by

	specifying the character(s) for the prompt immediately following

	the '=p'.


		 For example, specifying 'MYFILE.123=p?' would cause the

		 program to wait for the receiving computer to send a

		 question mark before the program continued transmitting

		 the next line.  You can specify a control character as

		 the prompt; for example, '=p' followed by a control-R

		 would cause the program to wait for an ASCII 19.


	When paused for a prompt in the line pacing transmit mode, you

	always have the option of proceeding with transmission manually

	by hitting the space bar, or terminating transmission by hitting

	Alt-T.


	You can store pacing instructions as one of the parameters in the

	Dialing Directory (described below).


	**Technical Note:

	The Pacing option will automatically strip line feed characters

	(ASCII 10) during transmission.  It will also add a space

	preceding each carriage return (ASCII 13).  In other words, each

	carriage return/line feed sequence (ASCII 13/10) in the file will

	be transmitted as a space/carriage return (ASCII 32/13).  The



	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 23


	Pacing routine will then either pause for the specified time

	delay, or wait for the specified prompt before sending the next

	line.


	If for some reason you want to strip line feeds and pad carriage

	returns with spaces during transmission, but don't want to pause

	with either a time delay or to wait for a prompt, just add '=p'

	to the file spec.  The Pacing routine will proceed without

	stopping. (Please note that if you specify '=p0' as the pacing

	option, the program will wait for a '0' (zero) from the remote

	computer before proceeding with the next line.)


	The pacing option is a powerful feature that greatly extends the

	versatility of PC-TALK in communicating with a variety of remote

	computer systems.  However, it is not recommended that you try to

	use transmit pacing unless you know of a specific need for it.


	One common application in which transmit pacing is useful is

	transmitting files to the Source using Telenet or Tymnet.

	Depending on how heavily the system is being used, you may find

	it necessary to pace transmission with a 2- or 3-second delay

	between lines to make sure that your file is properly received by

	the remote system.

	XMODEM Transmitting and Receiving: '=x'


	One of the noteworthy features in PC-TALK III is the inclusion of

	the XMODEM protocol originally developed by Ward Christensen.

	The purpose of the XMODEM protocol is to guard against

	inaccuracies in file transfer caused by bad signals on the

	telephone line. It is a "hand-shaking" and error-checking

	protocol that ensures accurate transmission and receipt of data

	and binary files.  The protocol is in wide use today among a

	variety of microcomputer systems.


	The XMODEM protocol can be used for both transmitting and

	receiving files.  In each case, you should add '=x' to your file

	specifications; for example, 'MYFILE.123=x'.


	Once you have entered the file spec and pressed <Enter>, you will

	see a message indicating that the protocol is in effect and the

	notice, "*** Holding for Start..."  The rest of the file transfer

	occurs automatically.


	If you are transmitting, line 25 of the screen will indicate how

	many blocks (of 128 bytes) comprise the file.  You will see a

	message "Sending block # n", followed by the message "- verified"

	when the remote computer has successfully received that block.

	The file transfer will proceed, block by block, until the end of

	the file is reached.  The transfer will then terminate

	automatically.





	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 25


	If you are receiving, you will see the same "*** Holding for

	Start..." notice, followed by messages "Received block # n -

	verified" as each block is received.  You will not see any

	indication of how long the file is, but the receiving routine

	will terminate automatically.


	If the program detects an error while transferring the file, you

	will see either a message "**Re-sending block..." in transmit

	mode, or a variety of error messages in receive mode.  In either

	case, the program will attempt to recover, indicate when the

	transmission/receipt is verified, and continue with the transfer.


	In some cases, the program will not be able to recover,

	particularly if the line signal is degraded.  The transfer will

	automatically terminate after repeated errors.	You can also

	terminate manually at any time by pressing Alt-R or Alt-T.


	If the XMODEM transfer does not succeed, please do not assume

	that there is something wrong with your computer or with PC-TALK.

	It is suggested that you hang up, re-establish communications

	over a new line, and try again.


	To operate with the XMODEM protocol, you must be communicating at

	8 data bits, No parity (Communications Parameter options 2 or 4

	-- see below). Both computers must have communications software

	capable of running the XMODEM protocol.


	The XMODEM routine in PC-TALK III  has been tested with other

	implementations of the protocol and should give you good results.

	If the other computer is running PC-TALK III, you can be



	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 26


	reasonably assured of a rapid and accurate file transfer.


	The XMODEM routine operates automatically.  For those who are

	interested, a brief technical description of how the file

	transfer takes place can be found in Appendix B at the end of

	this documentation.


	Before leaving the subject of XMODEM, it is appropriate that

	acknowledgment be given to Ward Christensen, who originated the

	protocol and who has been a landmark pioneer in computer

	communications.

		    ----------------------------------------



	A Note on Communications Terminology --


	The PC-TALK prompts and documentation generally avoid use of the

	words 'uploading' and 'downloading'. A convention in the

	mainframe world has been to use 'uploading' to refer to

	transmitting a file to a remote computer and 'downloading' to

	refer to receiving a file from a remote computer.  In the case of

	two microcomputers communicating with each other, the notion of

	'up' and 'down' seems less appropriate.


	For those who feel more comfortable with the mainframe terms, PC-

	TALK offers the option of using the PgDn key (in addition to Alt-

	R) to start and stop Receiving a file and the PgUp key (in

	addition to Alt-T) to start and stop Transmitting a file.

			   === More File Commands ===



	Status Messages: Alt-M


	The Message option (invoked with Alt-M) will send messages to the

	remote computer when receiving and transmitting files.


	When receiving a file with the Message option in effect, the

	message "===READY TO RECEIVE===" will be sent to the remote

	computer as soon as the receiving routine is in operation and

	"===FILE RECEIVED===" when the receiving routine is terminated.


	During transmission, the messages are "0 '===START OF FILE==="

	and "65529 '===END OF FILE===" or, if the file was terminated

	prematurely, "===TRANSMISSION OF FILE TERMINATED===". These

	messages will appear on the remote computer's terminal, signalled

	with a "bell" or "beep".


	**Applications and Advanced Features:

	The best use of the Message function is for the receiving

	computer to have Messages ON and the transmitting computer to

	have Messages OFF.  That way, the transmitting computer knows

	when the receiving computer is ready to receive the file.


	The numbers in the Transmit messages do make it possible to have

	the Message function active when transmitting a BASIC file in

	ASCII format.  The messages then become remarks in the

	transmitted program.

		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 28



	The Message function should not be used when transmitting or

	receiving files to or from a network or mainframe system.


	The Receive and Transmit file specification prompts are always

	displayed on your screen, regardless of whether the Message

	option is in effect. These local messages are not transmitted and

	do not interrupt communications.

		  ---------------------------------------------



	Viewing a File: Alt-V


	PC-TALK permits you to view any file which is on your disk drives

	while the program is running. This feature makes it possible for

	you to refer to files on disk while communications are in progress.


	To View a file, press Alt-V. The program will ask for file

	specifications in the same manner as the procedures for

	transmitting and receiving files.


	Once Viewing is in progress, twenty lines of the file will be

	displayed on the screen at a time.  To see more of the file,

	press the space bar.  To cancel the Viewing routine, press Alt-V

	again.


	The text of the file you see displayed on your screen will not be

	sent to the remote computer.


	**Applications and Advanced Features:

	If the remote computer sends you information while you are

	viewing a file, that information will be stored in the

		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 29


	communications buffer.	A continuous stream of information from

	the remote computer could overflow the buffer.	You should

	therefore view a file only during a pause in communications.


	You can print the contents of the file as you are viewing it

	by turning on the Printout function (Ctrl-PrtSc) before giving

	the Alt-V command. You can also print selective portions of the

	file by using the Printscreen function (Shift-PrtSc).

		  ---------------------------------------------



	Deleting a File: Alt-Y


	You can delete any file from your disk(s) while communications

	are in progress. Press Alt-Y and follow the file specification

	prompts. You will be shown the first five lines of the file and

	then asked whether you are sure that you want to delete the file.

	If you respond 'y' to the prompt, the file will be permanently

	deleted from your disk. Be careful!

		    ----------------------------------------



	The Logged Drive: Alt-L


	For the Transmit, Receive, View, and Delete routines, the program

	assumes a default "Logged" drive if no drive is given as part of

	the file specification prompts.  Initially, this is drive B.


		 For example, if drive B is the Logged drive and you

		 respond to a file specification prompt with just

		 'MYFILE', the program will automatically look for a file

		 'B:MYFILE'. If you want to transmit, receive, or view a

		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 30



		 file on drive A, you should respond to the file

		 specification prompt with 'A:MYFILE'.


	To change the Logged drive during program operation, press Alt-L

	and follow the instructions.  The Logged drive can also be

	changed as part of the Default modification routine (described

	below).

		    ----------------------------------------



	File Specification Conventions --


	PC-TALK III uses a standard set of commands for responding to

	file specification prompts in the Receive, Transmit, View, and

	Delete routines.


	If you do not include a drive indicator as part of the

	specification  (e.g., 'MYFILE.123'), the program will assume that

	the file is to be located on the Logged drive (see above).


	If you would like to see a list of the files presently on the

	Logged drive, you can type a question mark in place of the file

	spec.  You will be shown a listing of the files on the Logged

	drive.	To see the files on another drive, type a question mark

	followed by the letter designation of the drive.


		 For example, if drive B is the Logged drive and you

		 respond to a file spec prompt with '?', you will be

		 shown a list of the files on drive B.	If you respond

		 with '?a', you will be shown a list of the files on

		 drive A.

		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 31




	You can also use the 'wild card' characters '*' and '?' as part

	of these file listing requests.


		 For example, if you respond to the file spec prompt with

		 '? a:*.bas', you will be shown a list of all the files

		 on drive A with the extension '.bas'.


	If you decide you do not want to continue with the Receive,

	Transmit, View, or Delete routines once you have made your

	initial request with  Alt-R, -T, -V, or -Y, press <Enter> at the

	file spec prompt and the routine will be cancelled.


	If the Receive, Transmit, or View routines are invoked more than

	once during a communications session, you can hit the space bar

	in response to the file spec prompt, and the name of the last

	file specified for receiving, transmitting, or viewing will

	appear.  You can then either press <Enter> and continue

	receiving, transmitting or viewing that file, or modify that file

	spec before pressing <Enter>.

				 === Dialing ===



	The Dialing Directory: Alt-D


	The Alt-D command calls up the Dialing Directory, which is one of

	PC-TALK'S  most useful features.  The Directory can list up to

	sixty names and phone numbers, plus communications parameters and

	echo, message, stripping and pacing instructions for each entry.


	The following instructions will first show you how to place names

	and phone numbers into the Directory and then describe how to use

	the Directory as part of your standard communications routines.


	When the Directory is called up for the first time, all entries

	will be blank. To add names and phone numbers to the Directory or

	to revise the Directory later on, enter 'r' at the "Dial entry

	#:" prompt. (It doesn't matter whether you use lower or upper

	case.) Then enter the entry number you want to add or revise.


	To add/revise entries, type in the name, followed by <Enter>, and

	the phone number (area codes optional), followed by <Enter>. Up

	to 36 characters may be specified for the phone number; only the

	rightmost 14 characters will be displayed in the Directory.


	You will then be asked whether the communications parameters are

	"ok". If 300 baud-even parity-seven data bits-one stop bit is

	acceptable (this is the most common protocol), type 'y' <Enter>.

	If you respond with 'n', you will be asked to specify



	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 33


	communications parameters. The program will not let you dial

	using invalid parameters. (If you run into trouble, re-specify

	'300-E-7-1'.)


	The revise entry routine will then ask whether you want to echo

	characters to the screen (common for inter-personal computer

	communications, but usually not necessary for public networks

	such as CompuServe and the Source), and whether you want to send

	status messages as part of the file Receiving and Transmitting

	routines (see above). Press <Enter> after responding to each

	prompt.


	The routine will then ask whether you want to strip or convert

	characters for that entry.  It is recommended that you respond

	with 'n' unless you have a special applications need. (See the

	explanation of the Stripping option below.)


	Finally, the routine will ask whether you want to specify a

	Pacing instruction for that entry.


	If you want to specify a Pacing instruction, enter either a time

	delay number or a pacing prompt character in response to the

	"Pacing? p=" prompt. Respond with 'n' <Enter> if you do not want

	any pacing in effect for that entry. It is recommended that you

	do not specify a Pacing instruction unless you know of a specific

	need for it.


	If you make an error specifying a directory entry, type 'n'

	<Enter> at the final "ok?".  You will be taken through the

	specification routine again.  For each parameter, you can either

		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 34


	specify a new value or press <Enter> to leave the present value

	unchanged.


	After you have responded with 'y' to the final "ok?" prompt, the

	Directory will clear, showing the new information you input. The

	name, phone number, and communications specs will be permanently

	stored in a separate file on your program disk named PC-TALK.DIR.

		    ----------------------------------------


	Adding to the Directory --


	As indicated above, specifying communications parameters, echo,

	message, stripping, and pacing can all be considered advanced

	features that need not be dealt with the first time you use the

	program.  The following example lists the commands for merely

	adding a name and phone number to the Directory.


	1. Press Alt-D.  You will see Page 1 of the Directory displayed
	and the prompt "Dial entry #:".


	2. Type 'r' <Enter>. You will see the prompt "Revise/add entry #:".


	3. Type '1' <Enter>. You will see the prompt "Name:".


	4. Type the name you want for entry #1 (maximum 20 characters)
	followed by <Enter>. You will see the prompt "Phone number:".


	5. Type the phone number you want for entry #1 (maximum 36
	characters) followed by <Enter>. You will see the prompt
	"Communications parameters ok (y/n)?".


	6. For this example, the parameters are ok, so type 'y' <Enter>,
	or just press <Enter>.	You will see the prompt "Echo on (y/n)?".


	7. Type 'n' <Enter> or just press <Enter>. You will see the
	prompt "Messages on (y/n)?".

		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 35




	8. Type 'n' <Enter> or just press <Enter>. You will see the
	prompt "Strip/convert characters (y/n)?".


	9. Type 'n' <Enter> or just press <Enter>. You will see the
	prompt "Pacing? p=".


	10. Type 'n' <Enter> or just press <Enter>. You will see the
	prompt "Is entry #1 ok (y/n)?".


	11. Type 'y' <Enter> or just press <Enter>. You will see Page 1
	of the Directory re-displayed with the name and phone number you
	just entered.


	12. Repeat the above steps for each name and phone number you
	want to add to the Directory.

		    ----------------------------------------



	Other Directory Options --


	Although the Directory has a capacity of sixty entries, the

	screen will display only fifteen entries at a time.  You can

	"page" forward or back through the directory by entering 'f' or

	'b' at the initial "Dial entry #:" prompt.


	You can dial any entry, regardless of whether it is displayed.

	However, you can revise only those entries that are on the

	displayed page of the Directory.


	If you enter 'c' at the "Dial entry #:" prompt, you have the

	option of clearing Directory entry #s within the range 1-60.  You

	will be asked "Are you sure?" before your selected entries are cleared.

	Auto-dialing --


	The Dialing Directory will automatically dial a Directory entry

	if your modem supports this function.


	The first time the Directory is called up, you will see a notice

	that says "modem dialing command = ATDT". This is the command

	used by the D.C. Hayes Smartmodems<tm> for using touch tone dialing.


	To specify a different dialing command--such as for pulse dialing

	or for another auto-dial modem--enter 'r' to revise the

	Directory and then type 'm' <Enter> at the "Revise/add entry #:"

	prompt. Then type your desired dialing command, followed by

	<Enter>.  (The Smartmodem command for pulse dialing would be

	'ATDP'.)


	Whatever modem dialing command you specify will be permanently

	stored in the Directory file (until revised again).


	Once the appropriate dialing command has been entered in the

	Directory, you can have the program dial phone numbers

	automatically. Simply type the Directory entry # you wish to

	call, followed by <Enter>. The phone number listed for that entry

	will then be dialed.

		    ----------------------------------------


	Long Distance Services:  '+#' and '-#'


	The Dialing Directory is also able to route calls through

	supplemental long distance services such as Sprint<tm> and



	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 37


	MCI<tm>. Two different service numbers can be stored in the

	Directory, which are listed in the Directory as '+#' and '-#'.


	To add a long distance service number to the Directory, type 'r'

	<Enter> at the "Dial entry #:" prompt.  Then type '+' or '-' plus

	<Enter> at the "Revise/add entry #:" prompt.  You can then

	specify a long distance number command.


	When entering the long distance number, include both your local

	access number and your i.d. number. Separate the two numbers with

	your modem's "pause" command indicators (commas on the

	Smartmodem) so that your i.d. number will not be input until a

	connection with the access number has been made. The long

	distance service # might thus appear in the Dialing Directory as:

	'987 6543,,,,123456'.


	If your long distance service requires a different sequence --

	such as inputting your account number following the number dialed

	-- you can program a Function key combination for your account

	number. See "The Function Key Directory" below.


	Once a long distance service # has been entered into the

	Directory, it will reside there permanently (until revised) and

	display whenever the Directory is called up.


	To dial a Directory entry # using the long distance service,

	input a '+' or a '-' immediately preceding the desired entry #.


		 For example, to dial Directory entry #3 using the

		 service number listed as '+#', you would type '+3'

		 <Enter> at the "Dial entry #:" prompt.

		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 38



	Manual Dialing: 'm'


	You can also use auto-dialing to call phone numbers not stored in

	the Dialing Directory. From the main Dialing Directory prompt,

	type 'm' <Enter>. A prompt will then ask for the phone number to

	be dialed. Type the phone number and press <Enter>, and the

	number will be dialed automatically.


	As in the Dialing Directory, preceding the phone number with '+'

	or '-' will route the call through one of the supplemental long

	distance service numbers (if they have been stored in the Directory.)

		    ----------------------------------------


	Redialing: Alt-Q


	If you have a Hayes Smartmodem<tm>, the last phone number you

	have dialed can be redialed at any time by pressing Alt-Q, which

	calls into effect the Redial routine.


	The routine will display the time the Redial routine was started

	and redial the number approximately every minute until a

	connection is made.


	When a connection is made, the program will sound an alarm,

	prompting you to hit any key to resume communications.	You can

	exit from the auto-redial routine at any time before a connection

	is made by hitting any key.


	You can adapt the Redial routine for longer or shorter delays, or

	for other modems with auto-dialing features, from within the

	Default routine described below.

	Stripping and Converting Characters --


	PC-TALK III provides for optional selective stripping and/or

	converting of characters as they are received during

	communications.  This is an advanced feature.


	The program default is not to strip any characters.  When you

	call up the Dialing Directory with Alt-D, the "Strip" column will

	show "N" for each entry, indicating that no stripping is to take

	place.


	To specify selective stripping as part of the stored parameter

	for a Directory entry, revise the entry and respond with 'y' to

	the prompt "Strip/convert characters?". You will then be prompted

	to enter the "strip/convert string" for that entry.  This string

	should be structured as follows:


	Each character to be stripped or converted must be specified with

	a three-digit representation of its decimal ASCII code, followed

	by a slash (/), followed by a three-digit representation of the

	decimal ASCII code to substitute for that character, followed by

	another slash.


		 For example, to convert the commonly used end-of-file

		 character Ctrl-Z (ASCII 26) to a space (ASCII 32), the

		 strip/convert string would be '026/032/'.  PLEASE NOTE

		 THAT A ZERO SHOULD PRECEDE THE ASCII NUMBER IF IT IS

		 LESS THAN 100.




	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 40


	If you simply want to strip out a character, rather than convert

	it, enter three zeros as the second part of the string:

	'026/000/'.


	If you want to strip or convert more than one character, continue

	with more string specifications.


		 For example, to strip all ASCII 26's and ASCII 127's and

		 convert each capital A (ASCII 65) to lowercase (ASCII

		 97), the strip/convert string would be

		 '026/000/127/000/065/097'.  Up to 3 characters can be

		 specified for stripping/converting in this manner.


	You will have opportunities to correct the newly-specified string

	within the revise entry routine of the Dialing Directory.  (The

	program pads the strip/convert string with extra slashes.) The

	strip/convert string will be stored in the Dialing Directory.


	When you dial a remote computer with the stripping option in

	effect, the appropriate characters will be stripped and/or

	converted during all incoming communications, including files

	that you receive with the Receive routine.  You can not have

	stripping in effect when you use the XMODEM error-checking

	protocol (described above).


	**Applications Notes:

	Please note that it is not recommended that you strip or convert

	characters unless you know of a specific application or need

	related to the remote computer you are calling.


	It is not necessary to specify stripping of line feeds for the


	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 41



	purpose of correcting the screen display, as PC-TALK does this

	automatically. (Line feeds are not automatically stripped during

	file receiving, however.)

		    ----------------------------------------



	Pacing Instructions --


	As noted above, you can also store a Pacing instruction as part

	of each Directory entry.  (Pacing is discussed above in

	connection with transmitting files.)


	If you have stored a Pacing instruction, the pacing suffix will

	automatically be added to each transmit file specification.


		 For example, if you had stored the pacing instruction

		 'p=2' for the entry you have dialed, and specify a file

		 to transmit simply as 'MYFILE'<Enter>, you will hear a

		 beep and the file will be re-specified as 'MYFILE=p2'.

		 If you press <Enter> at this point, the file will be

		 transmitted with a 2-second pacing delay.


		 Continuing with the above example, if you did not want

		 to transmit using the Pacing option, you could backspace

		 to eliminate the 'p=2' portion of the file spec, press

		 <Enter>, and transmission would proceed without Pacing

		 in effect.


	Please note from the above examples that the Pacing instructions

	stored in the Directory do not automatically transmit every file

	using Pacing--they merely re-display the Transmit file specs to


	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 42



	include the Pacing instruction.


	**Applications and Advanced Features:

	Even if you do not have an auto-dialing modem, you can use the

	Communications Parameter, Echo, Message, Stripping, and Pacing

	specifications to customize the program for different

	applications.  Store the name in the Directory and a 'dummy'

	phone number such as '--' or '<space>'.  Store the rest of the

	specifications.  Then "dial" the entry number.  Even though no

	phone number will be dialed, the specifications will have been

	put into effect.


	You should also note that when you place a call through the

	Dialing Directory, the Communications Parameters and the Echo,

	Message, Stripping, and Pacing specifications will remain in

	effect, even after the call is completed.  You might want to set

	up Directory entry #60 as a 'dummy default' entry to reset

	certain specifications.  You can also reset the program

	parameters and defaults with the Parameter and Default routines

	(Alt-P and Alt-F) described below.


	**Applications Note: CompuServe and the Source

	This version of PC-TALK requires that you place access numbers

	for CompuServe and the Source as regular entries in the Dialing

	Directory.  This enables you to specify various communications

	parameters and stripping instructions when calling these

	networks.  (You may want to place several CompuServe or Source

	entries in your Directory to reflect different parameters, such

	as 300-baud and 1200-baud entries.)

		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 43




	**Note that some of the Source utilities, such as UPI news, may

	send an ASCII 26 to mark the ends of articles or messages.  If

	you receive the files with these ASCII 26 characters, DOS will

	later interpret them as end-of-file markers and you will not be

	able to view the rest of the file, even though the information

	might still be there.


	If you encounter this problem, you may want to specify stripping

	of ASCII 26's as part of your Source Dialing Directory entry, or

	convert them to carriage returns (ASCII 13) or spaces (ASCII 32).

	In such cases, your strip/convert string should be specified as

	'026/000' (strip) or '026/013' (convert to carriage return) or

	'026/032' (convert to space).


	**Applications Note: Mainframe Hosts

	Some mainframe systems send null characters at the ends of lines.

	Normally, the IBM PC displays these as spaces.	These can corrupt

	the appearance of the screen.  A solution is to specify stripping

	of nulls in the Dialing Directory entry for that system.  The

	appropriate strip/convert string is '000/000/'.  Even though this

	looks like nulls are being converted to nulls (pretty strange),

	this procedure will work.

			 === Parameters and Defaults ===



	Communications Parameters: Alt-P


	It is not necessary that you understand communications protocols

	to use PC-TALK, but you might find it helpful to read the brief

	explanation of communications parameters included as Appendix A

	at the end of this documentation.


	Pressing Alt-P at any time while the program is running will call

	up a menu which allows you to set the communications parameters

	to one of four options.


	The most common parameters for personal computer communications

	are 300 baud, even parity, 7 data bits, and 1 stop bit (option

	1).  These parameters transmit text files as ASCII characters.


	To transmit binary data, you should communicate with 8 data bits

	(option 2). This option is also used to transmit "high-bit"

	encoded files (such as Wordstar<tm> formatted text files).


	Options 3 and 4 will transmit text and binary files at 1200 baud.


	Option "F" of the Communications Parameters menu permits you to

	reset the parameters to those specified as the program Defaults

	(see below).


	If you want to specify parameters other than one of the four

	options, you should first press 'x' to exit to the terminal mode



	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 45


	and then invoke the Default routine by pressing Alt-F.


	**Applications and Advanced Features:

	If either you or the remote computer is receiving unintelligible

	information on the screen, you are probably using different

	communications parameters.  Sometimes you will be able to change

	the parameters while communications are in progress, but it may

	cause a break in communications, depending on the system you are

	calling and the modems in use.


	If you specify 8 data bits, (options 2 or 4), your modem might

	not give intelligible result codes. Also, if you transmit text

	files using option 2, as is required to transmit re-formattable

	Wordstar<tm> files, your screen may display unintelligible

	characters during transmission. The file is being transmitted

	accurately, however.

		  ---------------------------------------------



	Program Defaults: Alt-F


	The "defaults" of a program are those values that the program

	assumes every time it is started.  PC-TALK makes a number of such

	assumptions, which can be changed at any time while the program

	is running by pressing Alt-F.


	When you press Alt-F, the screen will clear and you will see a

	list of the present program defaults.  They are as follows:


		  Baud rate  300
		  Parity     E
		  Data bits  7
		  Stop bits  1


	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 46




	These are the four communications parameters described

	previously. The permissible baud rates are 75, 110, 150, 300,

	600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, and 9600. Parity may be E(ven),

	O(dd), S(pace), M(ark), or N(one). Data bits may be 4, 5, 6, 7,

	or 8. Stop bits may be 1 or 2.


	Note: If you specify 8 data bits, you must specify N parity. Do

	not experiment with any of these values unless you have a

	specific application.


		  Echo	    N
		  Messages  N


	The default is to have both the Echo and Message functions

	inactive at program startup. To have either function be active,

	enter 'Y'.


	Note that both functions can be controlled by the Alt-E and Alt-M

	keys, regardless of how the defaults are set.


		  Strip #1    0
		  Replace #1  0
		  Strip #2    0
		  Replace #2  0
		  Strip #3    0
		  Replace #3  0


	These defaults provide the opportunity to strip and/or replace

	characters as they are received from the remote computer.


	The "Strip #" values represent the decimal ASCII values of the characters

	to be stripped or converted and the corresponding "Replace #"

	values indicate the ASCII characters to replace them.

	A 0 (zero) Strip value indicates that no character is to be

	stripped or converted. A 0 (zero) Replace value indicates that

	the strip character is to be replaced by a null (no character).


	The values listed in this menu are only the default values for

	program startup.  Stripping can be put into effect via the

	Dialing Directory, as described in detail above. Stripping is an

	advanced feature that should not be used without a specific

	application in mind.


	     Pacing p=	''


	This gives you the opportunity of specifying a default pacing

	instruction, as explained previously.  This default is overridden

	by whatever pacing instructions may be put into effect through

	the Dialing Directory.	The symbol '' indicates a null entry.


		  Logged drive	B:
		  Margin Width	70


	Both of these default values can be controlled by the Alt-L and

	Alt-W commands described previously.


	Please note that all of the above defaults can be controlled

	independently through program commands.  The values listed in the

	Default menu represent only the values the program assumes at

	startup.


	In contrast, the following defaults (those listed in the second

	column of the Default menu) can be set only from within the

	Default menu.

		  Screendump file  B:SCRNDUMP.PCT


	This is the specification of the file that is written to when

	Alt-S is pressed to activate the Screendump function.


		  Redial delay	  20
		  Connect prompt  CONNECT


	These defaults pertain to the Alt-Q Redial function.  The "Redial

	delay" governs the length of time between re-dial attempts (in

	seconds).  The "Connect prompt" specifies the message that the

	modem sends to indicate that a connection has been made.


	These defaults are set to redial every minute on the Hayes

	Smartmodems<tm>.  They can be adapted to many other auto-dial

	modems. (Consult your modem manual.)


		  Line 25 help	Y


	This default governs whether the brief prompt on line 25 of the

	screen is displayed.  To turn off the prompt, enter 'N'.


		  Foreground	7
		  Background	0
		  High inten.	15


	These three values determine how characters are displayed on the

	screen.  If you have a color monitor, you can substitute color

	values as explained in the IBM BASIC manual.  Be careful that you

	don't assign the same value to Foreground and Background!

		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 49



	These three values govern the use of the printer.  You can

	specify 'LPT2:' as an optional printer port, if that is where

	your printer is connected.


	The "Print init." default permits you to send characters to the

	printer for alternate character fonts.	The "Print width"

	specifies how many columns per line the printer will handle.


		 For example, to print in condensed type at 132 columns

		 per line on the IBM Matrix Printer, enter <Ctrl>-O (oh)

		 as the Print init. value and '132' as the Print width.


		  Comm. port   COM1:
		  Comm. init.  ,CS,DS


	The first of these defaults permits you to specify 'COM2:' as the

	communications port.


	The second default disables checking of the "Clear to Send" and

	"Data Set Ready" signals when the communications port is opened.

	This default should not be changed unless you have a specific

	application. Consult the IBM BASIC Manual under the OPEN "COM...

	indicate carriage returns when defining Function key and Alt key

	input strings (see below).  This character may be changed at will

	without altering the actual input string.


	The procedure for entering new default values is simple.  When

	you first call up the Default menu, the cursor will be paused

	next to the default for the baud rate. You can enter new values

	for all the defaults or leave them unchanged as follows:


	-- If you want to enter a value, type the new value and then

	   press <Enter>.

	-- If you want to leave the value unchanged, simply press <Enter>.

	-- If you want to enter a null (blank) value, type <space> <Enter>.


	When you do not want to change any more values, type <Esc> <Enter>.

	(Pressing the <Esc> key will display a small left arrow on the

	screen.)


	You will then be asked whether the new values you entered are ok.

	If you do not respond with 'y', you will exit the Default routine

	and all of the old defaults will remain in effect.


	If you indicate that the new values are ok, you will be asked

	whether you want to make the changed default values permanent.

	If you respond 'y', your changes will be written to a file called

	PC-TALK.DEF.  The new values will be put into effect, and they

	will become the new default program values the next time PC-TALK

	is run.


	If you do not want to make the changes permanent, your new values

	will be put into effect, but the old values will remain as the

	defaults the next time PC-TALK is run.


	**Applications and Advanced Features:

	The Default routine provides you with a great degree of control

	over your use of the program.  The program will do some checking

	for invalid default values, but you should be careful when

	changing the defaults and do so only if you know of a specific

	need.


	If you run into trouble specifying the defaults, you can exit to

	DOS and simply delete the file PC-TALK.DEF from your program

	disk.  PC-TALK will create a new default file if it does not

	locate the PC-TALK.DEF file.

			      === Input Strings ===



	The Function Key Directory: Alt-K (or Alt-J)


	One of PC-TALK's other powerful features is the Function Key

	Directory, which is called up by pressing Alt-K.  (To accommodate

	users of the KEYNOTE program, you can also call up the Function

	Key Directory with Alt-J.)


	The Function Key Directory permits you to assign permanent

	strings of up to 126 characters to the ten Function keys F1

	through F10, and to the combinations of Alt-, Shift-, and Ctrl-

	F1 through F10.  A total of forty keys can thus be assigned

	permanent strings, which can be used to input i.d. numbers, logon

	sequences, frequently-used phrases and other text with a single

	keystroke.


	The information in the Function Key Directory is stored in a file

	called PC-TALK.KEY and is loaded every time PC-TALK is run.


	The first time the Function Key Directory is called up, you will

	see that the keys F1 through F10 have no strings assigned to

	them.  To program a key (or to revise a previously programmed

	key), press 'r' at the first prompt.  You will then be asked to

	specify which Function key (1 through 10) you wish to revise.

	Type the appropriate number and hit <Enter>.


	You will then be prompted to enter the string you want to assign



	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 53


	to that Function key.  Type the desired characters, followed by

	<Enter>.  The directory will display the revised input for that

	key.  (If you make an error, press 'r' again and respecify for

	that key.)


	If you want to specify carriage returns as part of the input

	string, input a "right curly bracket" -- the shifted key '}' just

	to left of the <Enter> key -- at that point in the input string.

	If you want the input string to terminate with a carriage return,

	enter '}' as the last character of the string.


		 For example, if you wanted to assign the string 'ABC

		 <Enter> 123 <Enter>' to Function key F1, you would enter

		 the input string as 'ABC}123}'.


	The input string may be up to 126 characters in length; only the

	leftmost 30 characters will be displayed in the directory.


	You can "page" forward or back through the Function Key Directory

	by pressing 'f' or 'b' at the initial prompt.  This will permit

	you to assign or revise strings for the key combinations Alt-F1

	through Alt-F10, Shift-F1 through Shift-F10, and Ctrl-F1 through

	Ctrl-F10.



	Using the Function Key Assignments --


	Once any of these forty Function keys or key combinations have

	been assigned, hitting that key will send the input string

	directly to the communications port (sending carriage returns in

	place of '}').

		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 54



	Continuing with the example above, if you pressed F1 during

	communications, you would send the following to the remote

	computer:
				  ABC
				  123



	You can specify a new string for any of the Function keys at any

	time.  If you want to clear the key, type <space> <Enter> as the

	new input string.


	The Alt-K command can be used simply to display the Function Key

	Directory for reference.  You can page through the Directory as

	needed to confirm your key assignments.  To continue with

	communications, press 'x' at the initial prompt and you will

	be returned to the regular terminal mode of the program.  You

	can then proceed by pressing any of the Function keys to send

	an assigned string or proceed by typing information from the

	keyboard.


	IMPORTANT! DO NOT PLACE CONFIDENTIAL ID NUMBERS OR PASSWORDS IN

	THE FUNCTION KEY DIRECTORY IF OTHERS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR

	PROGRAM DISK. When you want to make a copy of PC-TALK for others,

	do not copy the file PC-TALK.KEY, as this file may contain

	confidential information.

	**Applications and Advanced Features:

	You can also use the Function keys to store filespecs.	Pressing

	the appropriate key will input the filespec in response to a

	Receive, Transmit, or View file prompt.


	You can include control characters (ASCII 0 through 31) as part

	of the input string.  The program will display these characters

	as their highlighted letter equivalents (e.g., an ASCII 12 will

	be displayed as a highlighted letter 'L').


	You can change the character used as the carriage return

	substitute from the right curly bracket to any other character

	from within the Default specification routine.	This carriage

	return substitute only affects how the string is specified and

	how it is displayed on the screen; the program always stores a

	"real" carriage return (ASCII 13).  Thus, you can switch back and

	forth using different characters as the substitute.


	A new user of the program does not need to have the PC-TALK.KEY

	file on his/her disk. If the program does not locate PC-TALK.KEY

	on the program disk, it will initialize and create a new blank

	Function key file. The same is true for the file PC-TALK.DIR,

	which contains the information used by the Dialing Directory.

	Hanging Up the Modem


        A common use of the Function keys is to store commands for

        hanging up your modem.


        For example, the Hayes Smartmodems(tm) require two commands to 

        hang up.  First, the modem must be sent three plus characters 

        to get the modem's attention.  Then the modem must be sent the 

        command ATH to get it to hang up.  You can set up PC-TALK to 

        store these commands on function keys as follows:


        Assign "+++" to function key F7.

        Assign "ATH}" to function key F8.


        (In this example, include the characters between the double 

        quotes in the key assignments, but not the double quotes 

        themselves.  The } character represents a carriage return.)


        Now when you want to hang up the modem, simply press F7, 

        wait for the modem to signal "OK" and then press F8.

		  ---------------------------------------------


        Temporary Alt Keys: Alt-1 through Alt-0


	In addition to the permanent Function key combinations described

	above, the ten key combinations Alt-1 through Alt-0 can be

	programmed for temporary custom input while communications are in

	progress.


	Pressing Alt-'=' (Alt-equals) at any time during communications

	will display a prompt on line 25 of the screen, asking for the

	key to be programmed.  Type any of the numbers 1 through 0.


	      --- FREEWARE - P.O. Box 862, Tiburon, CA 94920 ---





		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 56



	You will then be prompted to enter the temporary string for that

	Alt key. All keystrokes entered subsequently will input text for

	that key, until you press <Enter> (maximum 50 characters).


	As with the Function key assignments described above, you can use

	a right curly bracket '}' to include a carriage return as part of

	the temporary string. Control characters will be displayed as

	their highlighted letter equivalents.


	When a temporary Alt key has been assigned, the program will

	display the first seven characters of the programmed input on

	line 25 of the screen and return to normal keyboard operation.


	Once an Alt key 1 through 0 has been assigned, pressing it will

	send the assigned string, just as though it had been typed from

	the keyboard.  The Alt keys can also be used to input filespecs.


	You can change an Alt key assignment at any time by pressing Alt-

	equals, followed by the number of the key to be respecified and

	the new assignment.


	If you want to clear a key, press Alt-equals, the number of the

	key, and then type <space> <Enter>.  If no Alt-key assignments

	are in effect, the display on line 25 will disappear.


	**NOTE the difference between these Alt key assignments and the

	Function key assignments described above:


	The Alt keys can be easily reprogrammed during communications and

	are displayed on line 25 of the screen.  This makes them con-

	venient for holding temporary input strings needed for quick

	reference.  However, the Alt-key assignments are not saved when

	the program is terminated.


	The Function key assignments, on the other hand, are stored

	permanently on disk and reloaded each time PC-TALK is run.  This

	makes them convenient for storing id numbers and logon sequences.

	However, you cannot continue with communications while you are

	reassigning the Function keys.

		  ---------------------------------------------


	**Applications Note: Hanging Up

	In order to remain compatible with as many modems as possible,

	PC-TALK does not have a pre-programmed command for hanging up

	the phone line.  Many modems do provide such a command, however.

	For example, the Hayes Smatrmodems<tm> require that three plus

	characters ('+++') be sent to put the modem into command state.

	At that point, the command 'ATH' (all capital letters) plus a

	carriage return will hang up the line.


	These commands can be assigned to permanent input keys in PC-TALK.

	For example, the string '+++' could be assigned to key F9 and the

	string 'ATH}' to key F10.  (You cannot assign both strings to a

	single key because the Hayes Smartmodem<tm> requires a pause

	between the two commands and this version of PC-TALK does not

	provide for programmed pauses in input strings.

		   === Miscellaneous Features and Commands ===



	Elapsed Time: Alt-Z


	At any time during program operation, you can display the elapsed

	time for the current call by typing Alt-Z. For updated time, hit

	Alt-Z again. (The elapsed time is reset whenever a new call is

	made.)



	Exit: Alt-X


	Pressing Alt-X at any time will give you the option of

	terminating the program and returning to DOS.



	Sending a Break Signal: Ctrl-End


	Various remote computer systems use different signals to effect a

	break during communications.  For example, the break signal for

	CompuServe is a Control-C; the Source Break signal is a Control-

	P. Any key sequence (including all control key combinations) may

	be sent via the keyboard.  Some break sequences may also be

	programmed via the Function Key Directory.


	Some systems require a special "sustained" Break signal. This

	signal can be sent by hitting the Ctrl and the End keys

	simultaneously.  You will have to experiment, or consult your

	remote system's documentation to determine the correct Break

	signal to use.

	CAUTION: do not attempt to use the combination of the Ctrl key

	and the ScrollLock/Break key as this may terminate PC-TALK.


	Rubout: Del key


	The 'rubout' or 'delete' character (ASCII 127) may be sent by

	pressing the Del key.  In some cases this will display on your

	screen as a small house-shaped character.



	Command Summary: Home key


	An on-screen summary of all the PC-TALK program commands

	described above can be displayed at any time by hitting the Home

	key.


	Toggle Commands:


	The following keys toggle on/off their respective functions and

	operate at any time while the program is running:

		 === More Applications and Advanced Features ===



	Even though this section is described as "advanced," the

	following information should be of interest to all users of the

	program.



	XON/XOFF: Alt-O


	PC-TALK supports the sending of XON/XOFF signals to the remote

	computer in the event of a communications buffer overflow (see

	below), and will trap for XON/XOFF signals sent by the remote

	computer during transmission of files. The default XON signal is

	ASCII 17; the default XOFF signal is ASCII 19.


	If the remote computer sends an XOFF signal during transmission

	of a file, the symbol "<<XOFF>>" will be displayed highlighted on

	the screen until the remote computer sends an "XON" signal, at

	which time transmission will resume automatically.  If transmis-

	sion has been halted, it may be resumed manually by typing Alt-O

	(the letter 'oh') at the keyboard.



	Communications Errors: <<>> and <<OVERFLOW>>


	PC-TALK will indicate certain types of errors if they occur

	during communications.	If there is an ambient signal on the

	line, the program will display the symbol '<<>>' in high

	intensity.  Communications will not be interrupted in most cases,

	but this symbol should put you on notice that you are sending or

	receiving corrupted data.  On a very noisy line, you may see the

	symbol repeatedly.  You should disconnect and try for a better

	connection.


	With some modems, including the Hayes Smartmodems<tm>, you may

	see the <<>> symbol when communications are first opened.  This

	should not be a cause for concern, provided you do not see the

	symbol once communications are in progress.


	PC-TALK opens a communications buffer for receiving data through

	the communications port.  In most cases, the program should be

	able to process data as fast as it is received.  If the

	communications buffer does fill faster than the program can

	handle the incoming data, you will see the symbol <<OVERFLOW>> on

	the screen.  The program will then try to recover, by sending an

	XOFF signal to the remote computer, processing the contents of

	the buffer, and then sending an XON signal.


	Two situations should be noted which may cause an overflow

	condition.  If you are running the uncompiled BASIC version of

	the program at 1200 baud, you may experience an overflow

	condition if you are making use of the character stripping

	options, or if the remote computer does not support XON/XOFF.


	If you are trying to perform simultaneous printout at 1200 baud,

	your printer will probably not be able to keep up and eventually

	the buffer will overflow, even with the .EXE version of the

	program.  PC-TALK will attempt to recover by turning off the

	print feature.

		      === PC-TALK III File Information ===



	PC-TALK III is supplied with the following files:


	PC-TALK.BAS -- The BASIC source code for the program.  It will

	run on a 64K system using DOS 1.00 or 1.10 and BASIC 1.10.


	PC-TALK.EXE -- The compiled BASIC version of the program.  It

	will run under DOS 1.00, 1.10, or DOS 2.00 on a system with 128K

	or more of memory.


	PC-TALK.DOC -- The text file containing this documentation.


	TALK64.BAT  -- A batch file that runs the 64K version. The file

	contains the single command 'BASIC PC-TALK/C:1024'.  This

	sets up a 1024-byte communications buffer.


	TALK128.BAT -- A batch file that runs the 128K version.  It

	contains the single command 'PC-TALK'. The .EXE version can, of

	course, be run directly from DOS with the command 'PC-TALK'

	<Enter>.


	PRINTDOC.BAT -- A batch file with a series of prompts to print

	the documentation file from DOS.


	COPYTALK.BAT -- A batch file to aid in making copies of PC-TALK

	for other users.  It will not copy your personal .DIR, .KEY, and .DEF

	support files.

		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 63


	The first time PC-TALK III is run, the program looks for three support

	files.	If it does not find them, these three files will be created on

	the program disk:


	PC-TALK.DIR -- The file that stores Dialing Directory information.

	PC-TALK.KEY -- The file that stores Function Key information.

	PC-TALK.DEF -- The file that stores Default Menu information.

		    ----------------------------------------



	Programming Information --


	One additional file is supplied on the program disk: PCTKREM.MRG.

	This is a BASIC file saved in ASCII format that contains REMark

	statements.  It can be MERGED into PC-TALK.BAS to improve the

	readability of the program.  However, once merged, PC-TALK.BAS

	will no longer run on a system with 64K of memory.


	PC-TALK.EXE can be compiled directly from PC-TALK.BAS, as all

	timing functions are handled independently through the BASIC

	SOUND and TIME$ functions.


	Once PC-TALK.BAS has been saved in ASCII format, it can be

	compiled using the IBM BASIC Compiler with the following commands:


		  BASCOM PC-TALK.BAS /E/O/S/C:4096
		  LINK PC-TALK+IBMCOM


	The '4096' argument determines the size of the communications

	buffer and can be increased if you have sufficient memory.  For

	all but the most demanding applications, however, the 4096-byte

	buffer should be more than sufficient.

	Copying PC-TALK --


	You are encouraged to make copies of PC-TALK III and distribute

	them to other users, within the terms of the limited license set

	forth below.  A special batch file has been provided for this

	purpose.


	To copy PC-TALK III, insert the program disk in drive A.  From

	the DOS A> prompt, type 'COPYTALK' <Enter> and follow the

	prompts.   If you do copy PC-TALK for other users, please be sure

	to provide them with the PC-TALK.DOC and PRINTDOC.BAT files.

		  ---------------------------------------------



	Modifying PC-TALK --


	Please note that this version of PC-TALK makes use of virtually

	all the memory available on a 64K system when running the

	interpreter BASIC version (PC-TALK.BAS).  Adding any modifica-

	tions will exceed the memory capacity for 64K machines.


	This version of PC-TALK has incorporated the suggestions of many

	users who made modifications to earlier versions.  Some of these

	earlier modifications were posted on bulletin boards and became,

	in effect, "standard" modifications to the earlier program.


	There are still many more useful modifications which could be

	made, and we would like to encourage this grassroots improvement

	process.  The only "dangers" are of different people writing

	modifications which overlap or are inconsistent, and, of course,

	people unwittingly writing bugs into the program.


	You are free to modify PC-TALK as you wish to suit your personal

	needs.	One of the goals in creating PC-TALK was to produce a

	program in easily modifiable BASIC. We do request, however, that

	you do not distribute PC-TALK in modified form.  The reason for

	this is that when people have problems or questions, they

	inevitably contact us, and we have no way of knowing what

	modifications may have been made.


	If you do come up with useful modifications, please keep them as

	separate MERGE files which can be incorporated into PC-TALK.BAS

	at the user's option.


	To facilitate this process of creating mergeable mods, we would

	appreciate your sending us copies of your mods (on disk, if they

	are substantial).  In certain cases, we may want to endorse

	certain mods and "officially" reserve expansion areas for them.

	Program lines from 10000 up have specifically been reserved for

	this purpose.


	Please understand that our reason for suggesting that we might

	"approve" certain modifications is not in any way meant to

	inhibit your insights or creativity.  To the contrary, we're

	greatly appreciative of the improvements which have been made to

	the program so far, and we would merely like to make it easier

	for more people to share in future improvements.

	and excellent work.


	Finally, thank you to the entire PC Community for your many words

	of encouragement and your financial support.  PC-TALK and

	Freeware started as an experiment.  It seems to have worked

	beyond what anyone suspected.  I hope that you find this version

	of PC-TALK to be more useful and just as friendly as the prior

	versions, and that we continue to find ways to share our

	adventures in computing.

		 Regardless of whether you make a contribution,
	   you are encouraged to copy this program as described below.

		  ---------------------------------------------


	FREEWARE user-supported software is an experiment in distributing
	computer programs, based on three principles:

	First, that the value and utility of software is best assessed by
	the user on his/her own system.  Only after using a program can
	one really determine whether it serves personal applications,
	needs, and tastes.

	Second, that the creation of independent personal computer
	software can and should be supported by the computing community.

	Finally, that copying of programs should be encouraged,
	rather than restricted. The ease with which software can be
	distributed outside traditional commercial channels reflects the
	strength, rather than the weakness, of electronic information.


	The user-supported concept:

	Anyone may request a copy of a user-supported program by sending
	a blank, formatted disk to the program author together with an
	addressed, postage-paid return mailer. A copy of the program,
	with documentation, will be sent by return mail on the user's disk.

	The program carries a notice suggesting a contribution for the
	program. Making a contribution is voluntary on the part of the user.

	The program may also be ordered by mail for an advance contribution.

	Regardless of whether a contribution is made, the user is encouraged
	to copy the program for trial use by others on a private, non-
	commercial basis.  Payment for use is discretionary on the part of
	each subsequent user.

		       --- PC-TALK III User's Guide ---                 68




	Will the user-supported concept really work?

	Up to now, distribution of software has relied either on
	restricting access (and charging for the cost of doing so), or
	anonymously casting programs into the public domain.  The user-
	supported concept is a way for the computing community to support
	and encourage creative work outside the traditional marketplace.

	This is an experiment in economics more than altruism. Free
	distribution of software and voluntary payment for its use
	eliminates the need for money to be spent on marketing,
	advertising, and copy protection schemes. Users can obtain
	quality software at reduced cost, while still supporting program
	authors.  And the most useful programs survive, based purely on
	their usefulness.


	Please join the experiment.

	FREEWARE is the trademark of The Headlands Press for its user-
	supported software, but we invite all software authors to
	participate in this distribution concept.

	We would like to publish a FREEWARE CATALOG of user-supported
	software by program authors who are willing to make their work
	available on a free, non-restricted basis. If you would like your
	program listed, please send a description of the program
	(including system requirements) and the address to which requests
	for copies should be sent. Fulfilling requests and suggesting
	contributions are the sole responsibility of each program author.
	Listings in the catalog are free.

	We welcome your comments about the user-supported concept.
	Thank you for your support.

	Appendix A: A Brief Explanation of Communications Parameters


	The communications "parameters" are simply values that specify
	how data is to be sent.  The "baud rate" determines the speed of
	transmission--300 baud transmits at 300 bits per second (bps).
	Since it usually takes 10 bits to transmit one character, 300 bps
	is a transmission rate of approximately 30 characters per second.
	A rate of 1200 bps is four times as fast--about 120 characters per
	second.  (Your modem must be able to support the baud rate you
	select.)


	As mentioned, it usually takes a stream of 10 bits to transmit
	one ASCII character.  One of these 10 bits can be designated as a
	"parity" bit.  The value of this bit can be set so that, together
	with the other data bits (described below), the number of the data
	and parity bits is either "even" or "odd." The parity bit can also be
	set to be always one ("mark parity") or always zero ("space parity").
	If you have chosen to communicate with 8 data bits rather than 7 data
	bits (see next paragraph), there is no "room" for a parity bit,
	and so you must specify "no" parity.


	You can choose to communicate with various numbers of data bits.
	The most common values are 7 data bits, which allow you to send
	any of the 127 standard ASCII characters, or 8 data bits, which
	allow you to send an extended ASCII set of 255 characters.


	For every character transmitted, the communications program sends
	1 "start" bit.  You have no option to vary this number.  However,
	you can specify how many "stop" bits are to be sent.  There must
	be at least 1 stop bit, and this is the most common value.

	For meaningful communications to occur, both computers must be
	operating using the same parameters.  This is why it is important
	to know the parameters of the remote computer and why the commu-
	nications program must be able to set specified parameters.

	Appendix B: A Brief Description of the XMODEM Protocol


	Once the protocol is put into effect ("Holding for Start..."),
	the transmitter waits for the receiver to send an NAK character
	(ASCII 21).  Meanwhile, the receiver sends NAK signals every ten
	seconds.  Once the transmitter detects an NAK, it starts to send
	the file in sections of 128 bytes.


	Actually, more than 128 bytes are sent for each block. At the
	beginning of the block is an SOH character (ASCII 01), followed
	by the ASCII character representing the block number, followed by
	the ASCII character of the "one's complement" of the block
	number. Then the 128 bytes of the file are sent. Finally, the
	block concludes with an ASCII character representing the sum of
	the ASCII values of the 128 bytes sent (the "checksum"
	character).


	The receiver checks the block to verify that everything is in
	order.	First it makes sure that the block started with an SOH.
	Then it makes sure that the block number is correct.  Then it
	performs its own calculations on the 128 data bytes and compares
	its own checksum with the one received from the transmitter.


	If everything is in order, the receiver sends an ACK character
	(ASCII 06) to the transmitter, indicating that the next block is
	to be sent. If the receiver can't verify, it sends an NAK,
	requesting that the block be sent again.  This continues, block
	by block, until the entire file has been sent and verified.


	At the end of the file, the transmitter sends an EOT character
	(ASCII 04).  The receiver acknowledges the EOT with an ACK, and
	the transfer terminates.
